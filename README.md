# Open Web Map Operations Dashboard

Open-stack GIS frontend project for reviewing operational layers, regional filters, and map-driven status patterns without relying on vendor-specific UI framing.

## Snapshot

- Lane: Open web mapping
- Domain: Operational layer review and feature inspection
- Stack: React, TypeScript, Vite, MapLibre
- Includes: sample layer data, live map surface, filters, tests

## Overview

This project starts the open web mapping lane that follows the PostGIS service blueprint. It is designed as the frontend counterpart to the open spatial publishing work: a lightweight dashboard that can consume PostGIS-backed services, vector tiles, or GeoJSON feeds.

The current implementation is public-safe and intentionally self-contained. It uses checked-in sample data, MapLibre, and OpenStreetMap raster tiles to show operational map review patterns without depending on private service endpoints.

## What It Demonstrates

- React and TypeScript structure for open-stack GIS interfaces
- Region and status filters for operational review
- A live MapLibre surface with a GeoJSON overlay for layer review
- Layer cards that read as a map-side operations panel rather than a generic admin list

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Build the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Current Output

The current dashboard includes:

- a filterable layer list
- a live MapLibre map backed by OpenStreetMap raster tiles
- operational layer counts and feature totals
- a GeoJSON overlay generated from the checked-in layer metadata
